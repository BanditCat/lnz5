synopsis: Embedded domain-specific language for declarative vector graphics
description:
    Diagrams is a full-featured framework and embedded domain-specific langauge for creating
    declarative vector graphics and animations.
    .
    This package is just a convenient wrapper
    around the @diagrams-core@, @diagrams-lib@ and
    @diagrams-contrib@ packages, so they can be
    installed with a single @cabal install diagrams@
    command.
    .
    The package also comes with flags to enable six
    different backends.
    A Haskell-native SVG
    backend (the @diagrams-svg@ package)
    can be selected with @-fsvg@. This
    flag is enabled by default, so if you do /not/
    want the SVG backend, you must explicitly
    disable it with @-f-svg@.  The SVG backend does not
    yet quite support all the features of the cairo
    backend: text alignment and embedded images are
    the two main missing features at this point, and
    of course it can only produce SVG images. It is,
    however, much easier to install, so it is the
    out-of-the-box default.
    .
    There is also a cairo backend (the
    @diagrams-cairo@ package) which can be selected
    with the @-fcairo@ flag. It is fully-featured and
    can produce PNG, PS, PDF, SVG, or animated
    GIF output; however,
    due to its dependencies it can be difficult to
    install on some platforms (notably OS X).
    .
    In addition, there is a GTK backend based on the
    cairo backend, for rendering diagrams directly to
    GTK windows. You can enable it with the @-fgtk@ flag.
    .
    The Haskell-native postscript
    backend (the @diagrams-postscript@ package)
    can be selected with the @-fpostscript@ flag.  The only
    feature it does not support is transparency.
    .
    There is a Rasterific backend which is
    also Haskell-native (the @diagrams-rasterific@
    package) which can be selected with the @-frasterific@
    flag. This is a fully featured backend with the ability
    to produce PNG, JPG, TIFF, BMP and animated GIF output.
    .
    Finally there is a Canvas backend, also haskell native,
    which can be selected with the @-fcanvas@ flag. This
    backend allows users to write interactive images onto
    their web browsers.
    .
